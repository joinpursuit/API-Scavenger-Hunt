Status Code Scavenger Hunt!

Use Postman to find each of the following HTTP codes:


1. 200
	*website = http://www.google.com
	*description = The meaning behind this status code is that the webssite has successfully sent a response.
	*WWID = I would jump with joy, because this means that the website did exactly what I wanted it to do and I could use the information that I got from it. 

1. 301
	* website = http://www.goolge.com
	*description = Moved Permanently, this means that the page that existed there before has been moved to a new page or in this case, the correct page is a different page .
	*WWID = If I got this message in my own application, most likely I put it there in order to guide the user to the correct page to view. But if I did not redirect the user myself, I would wonder why my page is redirecting the user to a different page

1. 400
	*website = 
1. 401
1. 403
1. 404
	*website = http://espn.com/nba/stals
	*description = Means that the page that the url entered or parsed into the code cannot be found
	*WWID If I got this message, I would make sure my code was typed in correctly to make sure that nothing was mispelled and everything is syntactically correct

1. 418
1. 500


For each of the questions below, write:

1. The website which generated the HTTP status code
2. A description of what the status code means
3. If an app you were writing encountered this status code, what would you do (if anything) to resolve any issues?
