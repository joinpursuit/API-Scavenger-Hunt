# Part Two

API Scavenger Hunt!

For each of the questions below, identify a website and search query that will give you the appropriate JSON. Paste the url and a snippet of the json below. Googling the category + API will generally take you to where you need. Ex. https://lmgtfy.com/?q=cat+fact+api

1. A random cat fact

```js
endpoint = "https://catfact.ninja/facts"
data = "data": [
        {
            "fact": "A sexually-active feral tom-cat \\owns\\\" an area of about three square miles and \\\"\"sprays\\\"\" to mark his territory with strong smelling urine.\"\"\"",
            "length": 145
        }
    ]
```

1. A list of 150 random users in English.

```js
endpoint = "https://randomuser.me/api/?results=150"
data =  "results": [
        {
